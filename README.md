# SIMPLE DOCUMENT EDITOR

_This is a very early work in progress_

Right now it is just a proof of concept. I woke up the other morning and wondered if I can create a simple collaborative document editor. right now it's just an editable div, with attached MutationObserver and a websocket. 

Right now the code is messy, and after I add a couple more features will refactor.

Later I will start to list features in the issues.
